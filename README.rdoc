ChillyChaudry is an Indian kitchen in Nairobi, this is their prototype website. 

The site allows the user to browse the menu and place and order. ( payment system is yet to be organised) 

The orders are stored in a database, and can be viewed by logging in (click on the chilly chaudry logo). The orders can be viewed by kitchen staff and show a count down timer of when they were placed. 

The main business logic is in JavaScript, a bespoke shopping cart. 
The back end is Ruby.
